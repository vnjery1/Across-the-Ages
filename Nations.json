    "startIntroPart1": "Heaven's fortunes be upon you Tran Thanh Tong. You inherited your father's Empire, his legacy, and his enemies. The Mongols controlled China to the north and looked greedily towards your lands. They came three times. Each you, your brother, and the noble Viet people fended them off. But winning wars against great odds was not the only feat you achieved. You built up the grand citadels of Thang Long, Thanh Hoa, and Thanh Dong. You patronised the arts and sciences, bringing Dai Viet into a new age of prosperity and even introducing the first exclusively Viet written language allowing your court to write in its own way rather than that of China. The Tran dynasty would rule on in prosperity from the foundations you built and feats you achieved.",
